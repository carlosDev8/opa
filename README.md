Java Library (`libopac`)
------------------------
The underlying code that the app uses to connect to the different supported OPAC software systems and parse data from them is available as a separate library called `libopac`. It can also be used in ordinary Java projects because it does not depend on Android APIs. More information about the library can be found in [its own README file](https://github.com/opacapp/opacclient/blob/master/opacclient/libopac/README.md).
